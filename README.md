# fpldraft-web
This repository holds all the files for my Fantasy Premier League Draft analytics project.

I built a website with Python using the Flask micro web-framework. It is deployed at this address: https://notanotherfan.pythonanywhere.com/

The website allows a user to enter their FPL Draft League ID and view analytics on their league.
